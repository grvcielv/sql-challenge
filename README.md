Inside the folder 'EmployeeSQL' you will be able to see I have mulitple .sql files. The first one
being 'table_schemata'. As per the assignment we where recomended to use QuickDBD and use that schema
but I kept receiving an error that I was not able to fix, because of this I pivoted my idea and 
creating the table schemata the way we where taught in our lectures. After importing my data I continued
working on the 'queries_for_questions' and there I show my code on how I answered all 8 questions.
